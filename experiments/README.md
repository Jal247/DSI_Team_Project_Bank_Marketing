Modeling and Evaluation

Objective

The goal of this modeling process was to predict [insert target variable, e.g., "client subscription status"] using three machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost. Consistent evaluation metrics were applied across all models to ensure a fair comparison of performance.

1. Data Preparation

The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.

Features (X) and target (Y) variables were appropriately preprocessed.

Standardization was applied to the features for models requiring it (e.g., KNN).

For handling class imbalance, scale_pos_weight was used in XGBoost, while Random Forest handled the imbalance inherently.

2. Models

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that predicts based on the majority vote of the nearest neighbors.

Hyperparameters:

Number of neighbors (k): [insert chosen value]

Distance metric: [e.g., Euclidean]

Random Forest

A tree-based ensemble method that uses bagging and feature randomness for predictions.

Hyperparameters:

Number of trees (n_estimators): [insert chosen value]

Maximum depth (max_depth): [insert chosen value]

XGBoost

A gradient boosting method optimized for performance and efficiency.

Hyperparameters:

Learning rate: [insert chosen value]

Number of trees (n_estimators): [insert chosen value]

Maximum depth (max_depth): [insert chosen value]

scale_pos_weight: [insert calculated value]

3. Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were consistently used across all models to compare their performance:

Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified samples.

Precision: Proportion of correctly predicted positive samples.

Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of actual positive samples correctly identified.

F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

ROC-AUC Score: Ability to rank positive samples higher than negative samples.

5. Insights

Best Performing Model: Based on [specific metric, e.g., ROC-AUC], [model name] achieved the best performance.

Strengths and Weaknesses:

KNN: Simple but less effective for larger datasets or imbalanced classes.

Random Forest: Strong baseline with high performance across most metrics.

XGBoost: Performed best in [specific metric, e.g., Recall], likely due to effective handling of class imbalance via scale_pos_weight.

6. Conclusion

The comparison highlights [best model] as the most effective algorithm for this task. Future steps include fine-tuning hyperparameters further and exploring additional ensemble methods to improve performance.
